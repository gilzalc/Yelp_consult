# Yelp_consult Project Overview

The goal of the Yelp_consult project is to understand and predict the check-in behavior of restaurants in the United States, as well as identify the factors that influence and affect it. We employ various machine learning methods, including Regression (Linear and multi-variable), SVM, Boosting, random forest, and more, to analyze and determine the characteristics of a place that attract clients.

Data Acquisition:
For this project, we utilize two methods of data acquisition:

1. Yelp API: We extract business data from the Yelp API, which provides information about restaurants, such as their names, locations, ratings, reviews, and other relevant details. We then perform feature engineering on this data to extract meaningful insights.

2. PostgreSQL Schema: We mine a PostgreSQL schema that consists of JSON entries and a diverse set of tables. To enrich the data, we incorporate external API data from sources such as Twitter, Google Trends, and weather data. These additional data sources provide valuable context and information related to restaurant check-ins. We further engineer the features using techniques such as sentiment analysis, one-hot encoding, binning, and more.

Machine Learning Methods:
To predict the check-in behavior, we employ a range of machine learning techniques, including but not limited to:

- Regression: We utilize linear regression and multi-variable regression to model the relationship between various features and the check-in behavior. This helps us understand the impact of individual factors on the check-ins.

- SVM (Support Vector Machines): By employing SVM, we aim to classify restaurants based on their check-in behavior. This allows us to identify distinct patterns or characteristics that separate high-check-in restaurants from low-check-in ones.

- Boosting: Boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost or XGBoost, are employed to improve the predictive performance of our models. Boosting iteratively combines weak learners to form a strong predictor, capturing complex relationships and improving accuracy.

- Random Forest: We employ random forest algorithms, which consist of an ensemble of decision trees, to predict check-in behavior. Random forest models are known for their ability to handle a large number of features and capture complex interactions.

Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from the data. We utilize a variety of techniques to engineer the features, including:

- Sentiment Analysis: We analyze text data, such as reviews or tweets, to extract sentiment scores or sentiments related to restaurants. This helps us capture the overall sentiment associated with a particular place.

- One-Hot Encoding: We transform categorical variables, such as neighborhoods or cuisines, into binary features using one-hot encoding. This allows us to represent categorical information in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- Binning: We group continuous variables, such as restaurant ratings or price ranges, into bins or categories. Binning helps us simplify the data and capture non-linear relationships that might exist between these variables and the check-in behavior.

By combining these data acquisition methods, machine learning techniques, and feature engineering strategies, the Yelp_consult project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing restaurant check-ins and develop a predictive model for estimating the probability of check-ins.
